TechnologyUG Presentation - October 2018

The URLs and attached documents were presented at the Technology User Group (TechUG - https://www.technologyug.co.uk/) conference in Manchester on 18th October 2018. I have included them here for reference and ease of access.

This information is also available on my blog - https://www.bytesizedalex.com/techug-october-2018/

It should be noted that the slides are used as talking points and do not encompass the full discussion.

While I am happy for people to reference the material I would be grateful if any copies reference this repository or my blog.
